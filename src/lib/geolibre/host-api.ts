 * from this template should do the same.
 *
 * The contract is intentionally free of MapLibre and React imports: a map
 * control is referenced only through the structural {@link GeoLibreControl}
 * type, so the same definitions describe both vanilla and React plugins. The
 * concrete control type is supplied as a generic parameter where it matters.
